      <p>I’m a bit of a perfectionist with a passion for design. Currently, I’m a student in Fanshawe College’s Interactive Media Design program, where I am learning how use digital media platforms to design and build beautiful responsive websites.</p>
      <p>Prior to studying at Fanshawe, I completed a B.A. in English Language and Literature. Four years ago, I never would have guessed that I’d be writing writing code instead of writing essays. I’m new to the web design world, but I’m proud of the work I’ve done. Thanks for taking some time to have a look.</p>
